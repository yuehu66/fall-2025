# PS1 Julia Assignment - Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the PS1 Julia assignment functions.

## Files

- `PS1_Hu.jl` - Original assignment file (contains some syntax errors)
- `PS1_Hu_corrected.jl` - Corrected version with fixed syntax and improved structure
- `test_PS1_Hu.jl` - Comprehensive unit tests for all functions
- `runtests.jl` - Test runner script

## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Direct test execution
```bash
julia test_PS1_Hu.jl
```

### Option 2: Using the test runner
```bash
julia runtests.jl
```

### Option 3: Interactive Julia session
```julia
julia> include("test_PS1_Hu.jl")
```

## Test Coverage

The unit tests cover:

### Question 1 Tests
- ✅ Matrix generation with different distributions (Uniform, Normal)
- ✅ Matrix indexing and slicing operations
- ✅ Element-wise operations and conditional filtering
- ✅ Reshape operations and array manipulation
- ✅ Matrix concatenation and permutation
- ✅ Kronecker product operations
- ✅ File I/O operations (JLD, CSV)

### Question 2 Tests
- ✅ Element-wise multiplication (manual vs vectorized)
- ✅ Conditional filtering of matrix elements
- ✅ Multi-dimensional array generation and manipulation
- ✅ Random number generation with different distributions

### Question 3 Tests (Data Processing)
- ✅ DataFrame operations and manipulations
- ✅ Statistical computations (mean, frequency tables)
- ✅ Groupby operations and aggregations
- ✅ Cross-tabulation operations

### Question 4 Tests (Matrix Operations)
- ✅ `matrixops` function with compatible matrices
- ✅ Error handling for dimension mismatches
- ✅ Element-wise product, matrix multiplication, and sum operations

### Additional Utility Tests
- ✅ Random number generation with various distributions
- ✅ Array utilities (size, reshape, flatten operations)
- ✅ File operations and data persistence

## Test Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 39
- **Passing**: 39 ✅
- **Failing**: 0
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all major functions

## Dependencies

The tests require the following Julia packages:
- `Test` (for unit testing framework)
- `JLD` (for Julia data serialization)
- `Random` (for random number generation)
- `LinearAlgebra` (for matrix operations)
- `Statistics` (for statistical functions)
- `CSV` (for CSV file operations)
- `DataFrames` (for data manipulation)
- `FreqTables` (for frequency tables)
- `Distributions` (for probability distributions)

## Notes

1. Some tests create temporary files (`test_matrix.jld`, `test_matrix.csv`) which are automatically cleaned up
2. Tests for Q3 and Q4 include checks for file existence and graceful handling when data files are missing
3. All tests use reproducible random seeds for consistent results
4. The corrected version (`PS1_Hu_corrected.jl`) fixes syntax errors from the original file

## Improvements Made

The corrected version addresses several issues:
- Fixed function syntax errors
- Improved error handling
- Added proper return statements
- Fixed indexing and broadcasting operations
- Enhanced documentation and comments
- Made functions more robust and testable

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Add performance benchmarking tests
- Include property-based testing for edge cases
- Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Include memory usage validation
- Add parallel execution testing
